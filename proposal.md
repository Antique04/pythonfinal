# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

PyBorg

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

We plan to build a synthesizer using Python, preferably with a graphical interface.  
Hope to keep adding features until we run out of time (volume control, chords, Arpeggios, etc)

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

We plan to make a synthesizer that takes inputs for volume, pitch, etc. and creates noise.
It will be written in Python and possibly use Max to create the graphical interface. 
We hope to include an arpeggiator, multiple oscillators, and the ability to play multiple notes simultaneously. 
Ideally, it will also be a VST (Virtual Instrument) that can be plugged into a DAW and used to output MIDI data. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Isaac Kraus, iwk@temple.edu, Jeremy Fan
Anthony Eckert, tuq50000@temple.edu, Jeremy Fan

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Makes noise, uses Max, sound is editable (volume, pitch, wave type)

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Basic graphical interface, multiple features to edit sound, Arpeggios, ADSR envelope

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Full graphical interface, Makes chords/polyphonic, is a VST that can be incorporated into a DAW. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

We need to learn how to use Python to make noise, how to incorporate Python into a graphical interface (instead of using command lines), and how to export something into a Virtual Instrument. 
We plan to divide up the work generally like this:
- Isaac will create a basic oscillator
- Anthony will build more on top of that depending on what makes sense (volume control, pitch control, etc.)
- Isaac will continue building from there
And then we plan to just alternate back and forth and see how far we can get with the project.
