# pythonfinal
Anthony and Isaac's python final project

Monophonic synthesizer dsp script written in anglescript, facilitated in Blue Cat Audio's Plug'n Script.
Exported product as usable VST3 plug-in, it uses simple sin synthesis. Using overtone math taken from a Blue Cat example, we were able to match some of the overtones to the original taco bell sound based off of a Yamaha dx7 preset.


Issues:

We wanted to include more paramters but the bare bones sound ended up needing to become the focus. The platform lacks a lot of documentation and available debugging, but using our knowledge we were able to at least produce some sound. 
Future development would entail fixing the distortion bug and the errors in the release algorithm.
